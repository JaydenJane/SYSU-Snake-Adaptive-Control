\section{Introduction}

Snake-like robots, with multiple joints and degree of freedom, 
have strong mobility in complex and unknown terrains\cite{Chirikjian1995The}. 
Therefore, they can complete tasks in many occasions, such as disaster 
rescuing\cite{DogAndSnake}, factory pipe maintenance\cite{ACMTutorial} 
and scientific exploration\cite{Kuwada2007Snake}. In the past decades, 
with the advent of orthogonal and universal joint structure\cite{1014757}\cite{Date2005Control}\cite{GaitBasedCompliant}, 
snake-like robots acquired the ability of three-dimensional space movement, 
which strengthens their mobility in varied topography. 
However, the movement of most snake-like robots in unknown environments is 
directly controlled by human, reducing the efficiency and limiting the 
implementation of snake-like robots. Therefore, it is an important and challenging 
task to give them the ability to move in complex environment
without real-time human intervention, that is, the autonomous mobility.

%It's necessary for the robots to have autonomous mobility if we want them to move in complex or unknown environment such as
%climbing the outdoor pipeline for maintenance. Actually, by setting the accurate parameters of motion, snake-like robots can
%travel along the pipes with different diameters by rolling gait. However, the motions of snake-like robots are not efficient
%under the real-time control of human. Our goal is to develop a new autonomous control strategy for the motion of snake-like
%robots. We propose a new control strategy based on learning experience of robots . The robots' adaptive motion can improve
%adaptability in different movement environments.

In this paper, we aim to address this problem by proposing a novel experience-based control strategy,
which autonomously determines the optimal control parameters of a snake-like robot in
current environment. The control parameter specifies how the robot moves under a given
gait. The whole process of our control strategy can be divided into two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item data acquisition and preprocessing,
	\item real-time data feedback and multi-parameter regression control.
\end{enumerate}
In the first part, we collect data that reflecting the dynamic states of a snake-like
robot in varies environments and then form a training set. The clustering
algorithm\cite{Cluseter_ICT}\cite{KmeansAndDeepLearning}
is adopted in this part to reduce the time overhead of feed-back control.
In the second part, we apply regression and feed-back control based on previous
training data of the motion of robots. The multi-parameter regression
is also transformed into an unit regression problem for higher efficiency.
We adopt the entropy
variance\cite{WaveformEntropyVariance}\cite{EntropyandVarianceasRiskMeasure}\cite{UsingEntropyAndVariance}
as the criterion for accessing the effect of the control parameters on the motion.
Then the most sensitive parameter which has the greatest effect on motion is selected
to perform the unit regression. By transforming the multiple regression into the 
unit regression and combining the weighted least squares algorithm\cite{gradientMethod}\cite{MSEestimates}, 
we finally get a fitted regression function and obtain the optimal value of the most sensitive parameter.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we also apply it to the our 
existing snake-like robot platform, which is shown in~\figref{fig:snake_like_robot_a}
and~\figref{fig:snake_like_robot_b}. 
Under our framework, the robot climbs pipes having different diameters and the
performance of climbing is reported. In summary, the contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A new framework for robot adaptive control is proposed.
 	      This framework greatly reduces the amount of  effort of the regression calculation 
           by adopting clustering algorithm for data preprocessing and the classification of 
           real-time data.
	\item A transformation of multiple regression problem is proposed to obtain the optimal
          control parameters in a real-time manner.
         The entropy variance is utilized to select the parameter which is the most sensitive 
         in current state. Then, by regressing this parameter instead of all the parameters, the 
         multiple regression is transformed into an unit regression problem.
    \item A set of case studies is conducted and the results demonstrate
    that our proposed strategy is effectiveness in accomplishing autonomous movement for snake-like robots.
\end{itemize}
%The robot has an orthogonal structure with 18 joints. Each joint has a rotation axis which
%is perpendicular to the body. The rotation axes of two adjacent joints are orthogonal with each other,
%thus forming a three-dimensional space movement. a set of sensors such as accelerometer and gyro
%is embedded in each joint to realize the feedback control.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. 


%The simulation environment is the pipe climbing, which can be used in cable detection of cable-stayed bridge. In the first part, we collect data in pipes with different diameter as training set. To reduce time of calculation in feed-back control, we adopt clustering algorithm\cite{Cluseter_ICT}\cite{KmeansAndDeepLearning}. In the second part, we apply regression and feed-back control based on previous training data on the motion of robots. We utilize the entropy variance\cite{WaveformEntropyVariance}\cite{EntropyandVarianceasRiskMeasure}\cite{UsingEntropyAndVariance} to measure the effect of the control parameters on the motion and select the most sensitive parameter which has the greatest effect on motion. By transforming the multiple regression into the unit regression and combining the weighted least squares algorithm\cite{gradientMethod}\cite{MSEestimates}, we finally get a fitted regression function and modify the most sensitive parameter.
